Features include:
- Shield Durability: Consider dodging. Shields can be re-bought at a shop.
- Stamina: Every combat action you take drains stamina. No longer can you mindlessly swing your sword about and win.
- Life Drain: Upon death, a heart container is drained from your life. Consult the Great Fairies for aid.
- Triple Damage: Those Deku Babas aren't playing anymore.
- Potions: Drinking a potion no longer pauses the game.
- COMING SOON: Hero Mode -- Challenge yourself in this mode where drained heart containers can no longer be recovered. Ever. Try not to lose them all.
